Heigwer, _et al._], 2016, GenomeCRIPSR - a database for high-throughput
CRISPR/Cas9 screens. _Nucleic Acids Research_, 45(D1):D679-D686.

Over the past years, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing has developed
into a powerful tool for modifying genomes in various organisms. In
high-throughput screens, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene perturbations can be
used for the systematic functional analysis of whole genomes.
Discoveries from such screens provide a wealth of knowledge about gene
to phenotype relationships in various biological model systems. However,
a database resource to query results efficiently has been lacking. To
this end, we developed GenomeCRISPR (http://genomecrispr.org), a
database for genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Currently, GenomeCRISPR
contains data on more than 550 000 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) derived
from 84 different experiments performed in 48 different human cell
lines, comprising all screens in human cells using CRISPR/Cas published
to date. GenomeCRISPR provides data mining options and tools, such as
gene or genomic region search. Phenotypic and genome track views allow
users to investigate and compare the results of different screens, or
the impact of different sgRNAs on the gene of interest. An Application
Programming Interface (API) allows for automated data access and batch
download. As more screening data will become available, we also aim at
extending the database to include functional genomic data from other
organisms and enable cross-species comparisons.

_et al._], 2017, Mapping of Wnt-Frizzled interactions by multiplex
CRISPR targeting of receptor gene families. _The FASEB journal_, 31(11):4832-4844.

Signaling pathway modules are often encoded by several closely related
paralogous genes that can have redundant roles and are therefore
difficult to analyze by loss-of-function analysis. A typical example is
the Wnt signaling pathway, which in mammals is mediated by 19 Wnt
ligands that can bind to 10 Frizzled (FZD) receptors. Although
significant progress in understanding Wnt-FZD receptor interactions has
been made in recent years, tools to generate systematic interaction maps
have been largely lacking. Here we generated cell lines with multiplex
mutant alleles of FZD1, FZD2, and FZD7 and demonstrate that these cells
are unresponsive to canonical Wnt ligands. Subsequently, we performed
genetic rescue experiments with combinations of FZDs and canonical Wnts
to create a functional ligand–receptor interaction map. These
experiments showed that whereas several Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a,
induce signaling through a broad spectrum of FZD receptors, others, such
as Wnt8a, act through a restricted set of FZD genes. Together, our
results map functional interactions of FZDs and 10 Wnt ligands and
demonstrate how multiplex targeting by clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 can be used to systematically
elucidate the functions of multigene families.

_et al._], 2017, Widespread Rewiring of Genetic Networks upon Cancer
Signaling Pathway Activation. _Cell Systems_ 

Cellular signaling networks coordinate physiological processes in all
multicellular organisms. Within networks, modules switch their function
to control signaling activity in response to the cellular context.
However, systematic approaches to map the interplay of such modules have
been lacking. Here, we generated a context-dependent genetic interaction
network of a metazoan's signaling pathway. Using Wnt signaling in
Drosophila as a model, we measured >290,000 double perturbations of the
pathway in a baseline state, after activation by Wnt ligand or after
loss of the tumor suppressor APC. We found that genetic interactions
within the Wnt network globally rewired after pathway activation. We
derived between-state networks that showed how genes changed their
function between state-specific networks. This related pathway
inhibitors across states and identified genes required for pathway
activation. For instance, we predicted and confirmed the ER-resident
protein Catsup to be required for ligand-mediated Wnt signaling
activation. Together, state-dependent and between-state genetic
interaction networks identify responsive functional modules that control
cellular pathways.

Cancer genomes often harbor hundreds of molecular aberrations. Such genetic variants can be drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis and create vulnerabilities for potential therapeutic exploitation. To identify genotype-dependent vulnerabilities, forward genetic screens in different genetic backgrounds have been conducted. We devised MINGLE, a computational framework to integrate CRISPR/Cas9 screens originating from different libraries building on approaches pioneered for genetic network discovery in model organisms. We applied this method to integrate and analyze data from 85 CRISPR/Cas9 screens in human cancer cells combining functional data with information on genetic variants to explore more than 2.1 million gene-background relationships. In addition to known dependencies, we identified new genotype-specific vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Experimental validation of predicted vulnerabilities identified GANAB and PRKCSH as new positive regulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. By clustering genes with similar genetic interaction profiles, we drew the largest genetic network in cancer cells to date. Our scalable approach highlights how diverse genetic screens can be integrated to systematically build informative maps of genetic interactions in cancer, which can grow dynamically as more data is included.

Voloshanenko _et al._, 2018, β-catenin-independent regulation of Wnt target genes by RoR2 and ATF2/ATF4 in colon cancer cells. Accepted in Scientific Reports

Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling route required for development and homeostasis. While canonical, β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling is well studied and has been linked to many forms of cancer, much less is known about the role of non-canonical, β-catenin-independent Wnt signaling. Here, we aimed at identifying a β-catenin-independent Wnt target gene signature in order to understand the functional significance of non-canonical signaling in colon cancer cells. Gene expression profiling was performed after silencing of key components of Wnt signaling pathway and an iterative signature algorithm was applied to predict pathway-dependent gene signatures. Independent experiments confirmed several target genes, including PLOD2, HADH, LCOR and REEP1 as non-canonical target genes in various colon cancer cells. Moreover, non-canonical Wnt target genes are regulated via RoR2, Dvl2, ATF2 and ATF4. Furthermore, we show that the ligands Wnt5a/b are upstream regulators of the non-canonical signature and moreover regulate proliferation of cancer cells in a β-catenin-independent manner. Our experiments indicate that colon cancer cells are dependent on both β-catenin-dependent and –independent Wnt signaling routes for growth and proliferation.
