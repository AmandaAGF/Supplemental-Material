Over the past years, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing has developed into a powerful tool for modifying genomes in various organisms. In high-throughput screens, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene perturbations can be used for the systematic functional analysis of whole genomes. Discoveries from such screens provide a wealth of knowledge about gene to phenotype relationships in various biological model systems. However, a database resource to query results efficiently has been lacking. To this end, we developed GenomeCRISPR (http://genomecrispr.org), a database for genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. Currently, GenomeCRISPR contains data on more than 550 000 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) derived from 84 different experiments performed in 48 different human cell lines, comprising all screens in human cells using CRISPR/Cas published to date. GenomeCRISPR provides data mining options and tools, such as gene or genomic region search. Phenotypic and genome track views allow users to investigate and compare the results of different screens, or the impact of different sgRNAs on the gene of interest. An Application Programming Interface (API) allows for automated data access and batch download. As more screening data will become available, we also aim at extending the database to include functional genomic data from other organisms and enable cross-species comparisons.
